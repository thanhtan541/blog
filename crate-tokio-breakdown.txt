what is a runtime?

- Runtime refers to the environment in which a program or application is executed or run. It provides the necessary support for the program to function and interact with the underlying operating system, hardware, and other programs.

Why is it existed?
- The runtime environment acts as a bridge between the application and the underlying system, ensuring that the application can run smoothly and efficiently.
- Let's consider a pattern that we used daily to capture the external service and expose a set of intuitive apis, called Adapter. Runtime is a adapter.

- Thus, same application code can run on different hardware, os, or in techinical term, cross-platform. Each platform has a dedicated runtime, e.g: Nodejs support Windows, Linux, Macos, AIX (IBM)

How does it work?
- Runtime contains a set of components
- A garbage collector 
- A compiler
- A set of libraries for core functionalities
- An execution engine that manages program execution, hamdling tasks such as loading code, memory allocation and threading.

- Examples of runtime environments include the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for Java applications, the .NET runtime for .NET applications, and the Python interpreter for Python applications.
