`MLS Protocol`-> End-to-end encryption protocol for large group has lots of members (> 1000)
- Problem -> The protocol used in Signal or Whatapps (Doulbe Rachet) is not optimal for large groups since the Keypair Exchange process increase key changes by power of 2
- Solution -> Use KemTree
- Context -> It only give benifit with really big group. 
- Consequences -> Complex operation to control group state
- Example -> OpenMls

`Primitives`
- Forward secretcy - FS
- Post-compromised security - PCS
- Efficient asynchronous kye establishment - Key feature
