If we take TDD as explicit as it is, there is one question certainly pop-up.

`How do we write test first?`

It would be tricky since we rarely have an overview of what we endup.

So?

To make thing simpler (the mighty goal of all software engineer), let ask other question that more important
 than write tests.

`Why do we write test?`

The answer is quite easy to answer, we want to make sure our final product (feature, piece of software, class, module) 
works as expected, or at least!

`How to define that our product works?`

Of course, we need to collect information about our product, or `requiment`

Example of a requiment
