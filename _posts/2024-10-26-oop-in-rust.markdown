`Polymorphism`
- Problem -> Reuse code
- Solution -> Generic Data Types, implement via Dependent Type.
- What -> is a type whose definition depends on a value.
- Reference: Why dependent types matter
- Usecase:
    - Function Definition
    - Struct Definition
    - Enum Definition
    - Method Definition

- Consequences:
    - No affect on runtime
    - Lower compile time
